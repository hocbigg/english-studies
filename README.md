# Summary
The curriculum is a complete education in English studies using online materials. It is designed to provide a well-rounded foundation equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate program, focusing on literature analysis, historical contexts, writing, linguistic principles, and critical theory. The philosophy emphasizes high-quality, accessible resources with a free-first approach for courses, while prioritizing authoritative textbooks (even if paid) when no suitable MOOC exists, followed by free/open alternatives. Intended outcomes include the ability to critically analyze texts, produce scholarly writing, understand literary evolution across cultures and eras, and apply knowledge in practical or creative projects.

## Organization

The curriculum is divided as follows:

- *Intro English*: Orientation and fundamentals to test fit and build essential study habits like note-taking (e.g., Cornell method), spaced repetition (e.g., Anki app), and peer discussion via forums.
- *Core English*: Roughly the first three years of undergraduate study; required foundational topics for the field, including surveys, theory, and key genres.
- *Advanced English*: Final-year electives; choose one concentration to go deeper (e.g., British Literature, American Literature, Creative Writing, or Linguistics).
- *Final Project*: A capstone project to consolidate, validate, and showcase knowledge; peer-review ready via platforms like Reddit's r/literature or academic forums.

Encourage community engagement through course forums, study groups on Discord/Reddit (e.g., r/EnglishMajors), and open discussion spaces like Goodreads. Balance theory with practice through essays and projects. Learners may adapt based on background; math/method courses (none here) can parallel intros if needed. Avoid redundancy by selecting the strongest resource per topic.

**Duration**.
1–2 years at ~20 hours/week, sustainable with built-in flexibility. For 1 year: 4 phases (~3 months each). For 2 years: 8 semesters (~6 months each, with breaks). Sequence logically, with clear prerequisites.
